# General

This configuration is originally cloned from [Steve Purcell's emacs.d](http://github.com/purcell/emacs.d).

My first priority is *stable*. So I use fewer cutting-edge packages from [melpa](http://melpa.milkbox.net) than average geeks. Average geeks use 500 packages, I have only installed 200 packages. ;)

To install, Download [this zip file](https://github.com/redguardtoo/emacs.d/archive/master.zip) and extract its content into ~/.emacs.d. Ensure that the 'init.el' contained in this repo ends up at ~/.emacs.d/init.el and old *~/.emacs does NOT exist*.

Thanks to Purcell, this emacs.d has [fancy features](http://github.com/purcell/emacs.d) for most script languages like Clojure, Python, Lisp, PHP, Javascript, Ruby etc. Purcell is basically a web geek who use all the modern web technologies.

I will support all the languages a desktop application developer use, like C++, Java, Lua, Objective-C etc.
